# PCA_For_Breast_Cancer
This repository contains the files and code for the University fo St Andrews modules GD5302 - Health Data Science Practice,
Practical 2: Modelling practical. The goal is answer a research question using machine learning algorithms on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. This project has explored how dimensionality reduction using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) affects the predictive performance of machine learning classifiers in distinguishing between benign and malignant breast cancer cases. The goal is to quantify the effects of PCA on the predictive performance of a range of different classifiers in breast cancer diagnosis.
